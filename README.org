#+TITLE: emotes-rs

Rewriting ~emotes~ in Rust.

Technologies (will use, since nothing much here yet)
 + ~sea-orm~
 + ~actix-web~
 + ~async-graphql~ (GraphQL because I'm tired of writing parsing boilerplate for web APIs)

** API documentation
Simple, because it should be simple. I will also document administrator/regular user privileges.
TODO this will be rewritten in GraphQL

*** Emotes verbs
Available params:
  - (optional for GET, required for all others) ~emote_slug~ for emote slug name
  - required ~dir_slug~ (if empty then it uses the root dir)
Queries:
- ~findEmotes()~
Verbs
  - GET ~/api/emote~ lists *ALL* emotes (JSON)
  - DELETE ~/api/emote~ deletes an emote
  - PUT ~/api/emote~ creates an emote
    - required ~emote_file~ with attached file
    - required ~emote_type~ with either animated/still/sticker (string)
*** User verbs
TODO (also add key generation verb here)
*** Directory verbs
TODO
